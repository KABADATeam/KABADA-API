"MACRO";"Political and legal";2;3;"Medium High";"A decline in demand could lead to a decline in production and a reduction in the state's economy. However, the positive factors of scrapping remain: the idea of saving the environment, rejuvenating the vehicle fleet, reducing road accidents and supporting the economy. Another measure by which the state has influenced the development of car sales in recent years has been an increase in the value added tax rate since January 2013. The excise tax, which is introduced for petrol, diesel and electricity, affects producers' operating costs. Manufacturers must handle these raw materials as efficiently as possible.";4;"The extent of autonomy of higher education institutions varies from country to country."
"MACRO";"Economic";2;1;"Medium Low";"According to the European Automobile Association (ACEA), the European Union accounts for around 24% of world production, a testament to the competitiveness of the European car industry and the experience of decades over which European industry can draw: two oil crises, technological advances and EU enlargement. .";3;"The level and nature of these risks vary to some extent from country to country."
"MACRO";"Social";2;2;"Medium";"The automotive industry is an important and traditional driver for the Czech Republic, not only due to the production of more than a million vehicles and a long tradition, but above all it employs a large number of people and employment is an important indicator for all individual sectors.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"MACRO";"Technological";2;2;"Medium";"In line with the social environment, the possibility of educating individuals, new media technologies with developed informatics and telecommunications, changes in social behavior and individuality are growing. The automotive industry is one of those industries whose changes in social aspects have necessitated change in societies. This means that developments in society determine the direction and viability of companies in the automotive industry.  Trends in new technologies have always been a highly innovative sector and this is not expected to slow down in the future. Developments in ICT information and communication technologies, new design, new materials and new types of fuel are the most anticipated.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries."
"MACRO";"Environmental";1;1;"Low";"The negative of cars on the environment can be divided into two categories: air and noise. At first glance, the car looks like clean and first-class goods, but it is incredibly dirty. At the time of the invention of the car, tons of ozone and other gaseous substances were added, which do not smell but are harmful to health. Environmental research is important not only for people, but also for nature itself. The topic of environmental protection is a long-term topic, but it is more important for the economy that the number of cars on the roads is not reduced and that as much production as possible is produced.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries."
"INDUSTRY";"Existing competition";3;3;"High";"Due to similar products made of the same material and the same technological processes, the rivalry between companies in the industry is great. In general, the industry: whoever offers to make a contract faster and cheaper will also get it. Sales prices are usually determined by the contracting authority. Firms are therefore limited in a situation of rising prices and the resulting growth in profits. Therefore, the company that reduces the price to win the contract, other companies usually follow it so as not to lose customers.";4;"The level and nature of these risks vary substantially from country to country."
"INDUSTRY";"Potential competition";1;2;"Low Medium";"Most existing companies in the industry produce as many products as possible, of course, with the lowest sustainable price. Therefore, each new entrant must expect high initial investments and losses before reaching its corresponding market share.";3;"The level and nature of these risks vary to some extent from country to country."
"INDUSTRY";"Substitution possibilities";1;2;"Low Medium";"New variants of means of transport";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"INDUSTRY";"Power of suppliers";3;1;"High Low";"Higher levels of innovation are pushing companies into areas with higher availability of technical specialists, which also corresponds to the current development of a growing number of researchers. The future higher level of market volatility is expected to cause slower market growth, as mentioned, and the number of vehicles sold in Europe will stagnate. These uncertainties also affect the position of suppliers, also due to the ties to the German and Russian markets. Thus, expectations for future developments on the part of suppliers are rather conservative.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"INDUSTRY";"Power of buyers";1;1;"Low";"Customers in the automotive industry usually have an overview of demand, market prices and supplier costs. It is not a problem for customers to change their supplier in case of dissatisfaction. That is why it is important to deal with clients properly and to process orders faster, which aims to strengthen relationships with the customer. In most cases, suppliers are also partly dependent on their customers, so there is often no exchange of suppliers.";3;"The level and nature of these risks vary to some extent from country to country."
