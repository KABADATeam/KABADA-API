"MACRO";"Political and legal";1;2;"Low Medium";"In the EU, freedom of the press is protected and political interference in publishing is limited. Nonetheless, if interference does occur, some types of publishing (such as news media and textbooks) could potentially take a severe hit. Another mechanism through which politics can affect publishing is via taxation regimes (e.g., VAT reductions for the media).";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"MACRO";"Economic";1;2;"Low Medium";"Demand in this industry is not severily affected by business cycles. Dependence on international trade conditions, interest rates, and infrastucture is also not higher than the average industry.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"MACRO";"Social";3;3;"High";"Demand for books and new media is highly dependent on prevailing tastes and trends. Not only do these tastes change over time, but they are often hard to estimate at any given point in time (in particular, it is not easy to tell whether a particular work of fiction/ art is going to be a bestseller). Furthermore, in response to technological shifts, demand for content delivered via a specific medium (such as the printed press of a physical book) can decline even when demand for the content remains solid.";3;"The level and nature of these risks vary to some extent from country to country."
"MACRO";"Technological";3;2;"High Medium";"Due to technological developments, the media through which the content is distributed change continually, necessitating adjustments. Although costly, these adjustments are usually possible without a complete overhaul of the business.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries."
"MACRO";"Environmental";1;1;"Low";"With human capital as the main input, this industry is not subject to a significant environmental impact.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"INDUSTRY";"Existing competition";2;2;"Medium";"The degree of competition in the industry varies by segment. While some segments (such as map publishing) are highly concentrated and offer a homogenous product, others (such as book publishing) have many smaller players and a rather high degree of product. differentiation.";3;"The level and nature of these risks vary to some extent from country to country. In particular, the competitiveness of the industry decreases in market size. Due to most content being published in a particular language and appealing to a particular cutlure, the market size is effectively limited by the size of the target linguistic/ cultural groups."
"INDUSTRY";"Potential competition";2;2;"Medium";"The threat of entry in the industry varies by segment. While some segments (such as map publishing) have high barriers to entry due to high concentration, homogenuous products, and highly specialized knowledge and human capital requirements, others (such as fiction book publishing) have lower barriers to entry to lower concentration,high product differentiation (niche sub-segments), and lower need for specialist knowledge.";3;"The level and nature of these risks vary to some extent from country to country. See comment on existing competition above."
"INDUSTRY";"Substitution possibilities";2;2;"Medium";"The main threat of substitution is toward decentralised production and distribution of content by independent content devleopers (mostly through social media platforms).";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries."
"INDUSTRY";"Power of suppliers";1;1;"Low";"Usually, the main input in this industry is content. In many cases, content production and publishing are integrated in the same company, eliminating market power concerns. When there is no integration, there are typically many more content producers than publishers, giving substantially more market power to the publisher.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries."
"INDUSTRY";"Power of buyers";2;2;"Medium";"Some publishers' business model involves selling directly to consumers, in which case the publisher has more market power. However, if distribution is made through a concentrated retail industry (such as newspapers being sold by large supermarket chains or newstand chain), the buyers may have substantial market power.";4;"The level and nature of these risks vary substantially from country to country, particularly with respect to the degree of concentration of the relevant retail industry (i.e., the number and size of retailers)."
"COMPANY";"Resources: Human";2;2;"Medium";"The industry does require specialist human capital. However, there does not appear to be a shortage of the requisite specialists.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"COMPANY";"Resources: Tangible";1;1;"Low";"Highly specialized equipment and facilities are not required, and the risk of critical equipment failure appears to be low.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"COMPANY";"Processes";1;1;"Low";"The likelihood and impact of random events/ failures on the production, distribution, and management processes in this industry are comparatively low.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries."
