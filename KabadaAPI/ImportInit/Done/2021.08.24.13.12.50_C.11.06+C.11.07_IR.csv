"MACRO";"Political and legal";1;1;"Low";"Less affected than most industries.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"MACRO";"Economic";2;1;"Medium Low";"Less affected than most industries.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"MACRO";"Social";2;2;"Medium";"The demand for different classes of alcoholic beverages is subject to large shifts in taste and social norms. Furthermore, due to generational and age differences in tastes, demand shifts can be brought about by demographic changes. The severity of taste shifts is likely to depend on the type of drink (larger for niche drinks, smaller for mainstream/generic drinks).
For others: Similar, but to a lesser extent; norms not relevant.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries"
"MACRO";"Technological";1;1;"Low";"New technologies speed up processes and allow for economies of scale, but traditionally produced products are generally perceived as premium and not in direct competition with mass produced ones.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries"
"MACRO";"Environmental";1;2;"Low Medium";"Availability and price of some inputs might be affected by climate change.
NOTE: Think about weather vs climate (what goes under economic/ availability of resources due to weather and what goes under Environmental).";3;"The level and nature of these risks vary to some extent from country to country.
Countries closer to the equator are likely to be more negatively impacted by global warming."
"INDUSTRY";"Existing competition";2;2;"Medium";"Status quo in other: Two main market segments: (1) a highly concentrated mainstream market along with (2) multiple niche markets (specialty/ organic etc. drinks) with many small players. Survival of smaller players much more difficult in the mainstream segment than in the niche segment.
NOTE: Here we talk about the industry structure, focusing on how easy or hard would it be for our new entrant to survive in this market.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"INDUSTRY";"Potential competition";2;2;"Medium";"Entry mainly affects the niche markets and the impact is mitigated by the differentiated nature of the products.
NOTE: This is about the threat of entry. We talk about the extent to which our enterprise, once it establishes itself in the market, will be threatened by future entrants. Note that differentiation (as in the specialty brewing industry) protects both existing players and entrants from each other!";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"INDUSTRY";"Substitution possibilities";1;2;"Low Medium";"Due to meeting a basic human need, water and soft drinks as a whole are unlikely to be displaced by a substitute. Internal substitution within the group, however, is common (see “social factors” above).
NOTE: Check what counts as emergence of a substitute vs. simply new entry in the same market.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries."
"INDUSTRY";"Power of suppliers";1;2;"Low Medium";"The inputs tend not to be highly specific (water, energy, sugar). For the more specialized inputs (flavors etc.), viable substitutes are likely to be available and supply markets tend to be fairly competitive.";3;"The level and nature of these risks vary to some extent from country to country.
Substantial international differences exist, but they are to a large extent the result of different predominant products and business models"
"INDUSTRY";"Power of buyers";2;2;"Medium";"The bargaining power of buyers depends on the chosen distribution channels and volume of sales. If most of the production is sold directly to consumers and via restaurants, bars, and cafes, the bargaining power of buyers is low. If much of the production is sold via wholesalers/ supermarket chains, buyers hold much more power. Switching between channels is costly and may not be possible in the short run.";3;"The level and nature of these risks vary to some extent from country to country.
Variations depend on consumption patterns (home vs bar consumption), government policies regarding the distribution of alcohol, and structure of retail markets (the extent to which the largest chains dominate)."
"COMPANY";"Resources: Human";2;2;"Medium";"This industry, especially its craft/specialty sector, is to a large extent dependent on the skill and experience of a few key personnel (master brewer/ distiller/ winemaker). Losing these key people can be disastrous to the whole operation and finding a replacement at short notice is likely to be difficult. Relatedly, to ensure continuity, it is important to keep detailed documentation of the employed procedures/ recipes. But for non alcohol drinks essentially, the same problems but to a lesser extent.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country.
Availability of skilled personnel for a particular drink may vary based on a country’s traditions."
"COMPANY";"Resources: Tangible";1;1;"Low";"After the initial investments have been made, the production equipment should last for a fairly long time. Repairs are unlikely to be excessively costly and can often be done in-house.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries."
"COMPANY";"Processes";2;2;"Medium";"It is imperative to ensure proper hygiene during the production and bottling process. Contamination can result in an inferior product.
NOTE: This is mostly about operational processes but supporting processes might be mentioned if they have industry-specific issues/ potential risks.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries."
