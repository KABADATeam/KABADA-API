In total, there were 511 000 persons employed in the EU-27’s forestry and logging sector (in 2018). Wood is also a vital input to downstream wood-based industries, while it is increasingly being used (again) as an energy source.

The future market price of timber. 3. In countries like Portugal, the growth of the forest-based industry is conditioned by two interdependent factors, the long cycle of forest production and the territorial dispersion of the forest and the added difficulties of its management by private smallholder owners (forest exploitation is carried out predominantly by micro and small companies)";4;"The level and nature of these risks vary substantially from country to country."

High pollution levels (regularly exceeding the European Union limits) and heatwaves endanger the lives of young and elderly people. Urban forests are effective Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) that help mitigate the effects of climate change while improving air quality, urban temperature and lifestyle of modern cities.  2. Main global cities are setting challenging urban reforestation targets while struggling to face related costs and citizens engagement to meet current changing and future needs. 3.

The consolidation of the industry, through partnerships or strategic alliances with other companies or economic groups, reinforcing the gains in critical mass, can be decisive.
