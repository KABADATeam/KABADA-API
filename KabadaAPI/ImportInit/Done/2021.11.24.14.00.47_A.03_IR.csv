"MACRO";"Political and legal";3;2;"High Medium";"As climate changes afect the quantity of fishes at wild nature, it's expected that regulations are more and more strict. International agreements are more likely to be pursued. Conflicts over jurisditional boundaries are expected. Catch rights are in in place as well as seasonal closures.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"MACRO";"Economic";3;3;"High";"Direct impact of climate change on marine fish stocks directly afect productivity. Also, fishery is very fuel dependent and this is a very uncertain market. Fish price is expected to increase due to the shortest of fish and political and legal constraints. However, projections over fuel and fish prices are dificult. In high value species, the volume of landings (supply) impacts fish price. A decrease in landings will lead to an increase in fish price.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries."
"MACRO";"Social";2;1;"Medium Low";"Most important impact is labor force. Differences lie in either it's an international labor force (as cheap as possible) or a local labor force, fairly payed.";3;"The level and nature of these risks vary to some extent from country to country."
"MACRO";"Technological";3;2;"High Medium";"Fishery operations will experience pressure in order to get more sustainable and economicaly viable. This will encourage the development and implementation of new technologies in old and new entrants. Fuel efficiency and catch efficiency are the two main concerns, but other improvements as is the case of survival of discards are also very important ones. ";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"MACRO";"Environmental";3;2;"High Medium";"Climate change is anticipated to have long-term and widespread direct consequences for the European marine ecosystems. Polution can impact  fish quality and food security.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"INDUSTRY";"Existing competition";3;2;"High Medium";"Fisheries from al over the world compete between eachother, leading to fish prices war. Big fishery companies can act as near monopoly in order to maximize the profit. ";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"INDUSTRY";"Potential competition";3;2;"High Medium";"As population increases, also the demand for food. The wild catch fishes and also aquaculture are expected to grow in demand and new companies. On the other side, there are other competition for sea waters that come from other activities, as for instance the offshore wind energy production, military activities or marine protected areas.";3;"The level and nature of these risks vary to some extent from country to country."
"INDUSTRY";"Substitution possibilities";3;3;"High";"Due to the higher demand on food, substitutes of wild fish can come from aquaculture. Also, fish and derivates are easy to substitute by other forms of protein. ";3;"The level and nature of these risks vary to some extent from country to country."
"INDUSTRY";"Power of suppliers";2;2;"Medium";"Fuel suply and prices are completely dependent on international conditions and it has a huge impact on operations and profit. Vessel, equipment and maintenance are mature industries that can be relatively predicted and competitive.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries."
"INDUSTRY";"Power of buyers";2;2;"Medium";"As substitutes are rather easy to use and fish catches and prices are more dificult to predict, the power from buyers increases. Huge distribuition companies also have a clear buying power, however, catch availability and sesonability may have bigger impact from the supply side.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"COMPANY";"Resources: Human";3;3;"High";"Operationalization depend on human resources available and the labor cost.";4;"The level and nature of these risks vary substantially from country to country."
"COMPANY";"Resources: Tangible";3;3;"High";"Vessels are very costly equipments. Depending on the number of vessels in the fleet, maintenance and substituition costs can vary from higlh impact to medium impact. ";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"COMPANY";"Processes";2;2;"Medium";"Technological efficiency directly impact profit as it can assume fuel efficiency and catch efficiency.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries."
