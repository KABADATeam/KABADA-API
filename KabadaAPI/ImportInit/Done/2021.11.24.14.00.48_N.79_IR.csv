"MACRO";"Political and legal";2;3;"Medium High";"Government policies, regulations, and laws different between trade bloc and countries (e.g. free movement of people and goods). Also the increase of political crisis (as a result of financial, social, health, environmental, etc. instability) are more frequent globaly and impacts on travels decisions from tourist. Global conflits have a huge impact in several tourist destinations. ";5;"The level and nature of these risks vary greatly from country to country."

The tourism industry is often described as being a “fragile” industry, and susceptible to various types of disturbances (shocks) such as wars, disease outbreaks, terrorist attacks, fluctuations economic, currency instability and energy prices, which unfortunately come with some
frequency all over the world . Also aspectss related with access to financial markets/ credit, and availability of human resources are important to tourism inndustry in order to garantee quality and differenciation determinant for the attractiveness of tourist destinations.  International tourism is counted as an export when, for example, a foreign visitor spends money in a given country, the logic being reversed for accounting for imports.

"MACRO";"Social";2;2;"Medium";"Tourism industry is dependent from variation on tastes, lifestyle trends, and cultural norms and values. Also changes on the demographic composition of the population affects tourism supply and demand. The problematic living conditions can limit the opportunities to enjoy vacations and, consequently, travel, on the other hand, the growing need for social well-being seems to contribute to an increase in the need for vacation travel.";5;"The level and nature of these risks vary greatly from country to country."
"MACRO";"Technological";3;3;"High";"Technology has completely transformed the tourism industry in every aspect. One of the main impacts is traveler empowerment. Technology has allowed the traveler to be much more informed and take a proactive role in travel arrangements. Now, the tourist is much more demanding, has several options to choose from and has bargaining power. He has also become not just a mere visitor, but a generator of content that he shares with other travelers, with the ability to influence the choices and travels of others.  On the one hand, technology and the internet made it possible to expand distribution channels. A travel agency can currently offer its services to any internet user who browses the net.
On the other hand, the in-house implementation of technology allows tourism companies to be more efficient. Many processes have been simplified thanks to technology.
In addition, the digitization of records facilitated the collection and analysis of data through Big Data strategies that allow us to know our customers better, close sales and retain them.
Another consequence of the implementation of technology in the tourism sector was that companies that failed to adapt, or did not carry out the implementation optimally, failed and in many cases had to close.";3;"The level and nature of these risks vary to some extent from country to country."
"MACRO";"Environmental";3;3;"High";"Tourism has impacts on the environment as it is a major
consumer of fuel, electricity, food and other water and land resources, generating significant amounts of waste and emissions in this same environment. For a growing percentage of the world's population, environmental preservation is fundamentally and extremely important for sustainable economic growth. In fact, the formulation and implementation of environmental policies depend on a chain of social agents, whose links range from the State and public agents, academia and scientists, economic sectors, the media to organized civil society and the population in general. Unfortunately not everyone is in agreement and consensus has been difficult.";5;"The level and nature of these risks vary greatly from country to country."
"INDUSTRY";"Existing competition";2;3;"Medium High";"Tourism inndustry is high competetive. E.g. a consequence of the implementation of technology in the tourism sector was that companies that failed to adapt, or did not carry out the implementation optimally, failed and in many cases had to close. The lack of digitization has been a major brake on this competitive market.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"INDUSTRY";"Potential competition";2;2;"Medium";"It is assumed in the extensive literature on competitiveness and tourism, that the more competitive a tourist destination is, the more tourists it will attract, bringing an increase in income through this sector, which will lead to an increase of production and economic growth. One of the best known concepts of competitiveness in the tourism industry is the ability of a tourist destination to add value and thus increase wealth through the management of goods and processes. On the other hand, global institutions for monitoring competitiveness consider that it is generated by the set of institutions, policies and factors that determine a country's productivity (WEF, 2015).
However, there seems to be a cause-effect relationship between aspects such as infrastructure, good climate, natural resources, and the ability to generate a good flow of tourism. ";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
