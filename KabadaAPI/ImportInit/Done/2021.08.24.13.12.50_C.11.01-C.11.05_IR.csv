"Risk Category";"Risk Type";"Likelihood";"Severity";"Total";"Comments";"Possible country-specific deviations (Score)";"Possible country-specific deviations (Comment))"
"MACRO";"Political and legal";3;3;"High";"Production of alcoholic beverages is a highly regulated and highly taxed industry and is subject to variability of these policies.";4;"Policies and attitudes toward the production, sale, and use of alcohol differ substantially by country."
"MACRO";"Economic";2;2;"Medium";"Demand fluctuates with income (especially for beverages such as fine wines and spirits, demand falls during economic downturn). As agricultural produce is used as an input, the industry is exposed to annual variation in crop yields and quality.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country."
"MACRO";"Social";3;2;"High Medium";"The demand for different classes of alcoholic beverages is subject to large shifts in taste and social norms. Furthermore, due to generational and age differences in tastes, demand shifts can be brought about by demographic changes. The severity of taste shifts is likely to depend on the type of drink (larger for niche drinks, smaller for mainstream/generic drinks).";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country"
"MACRO";"Technological";1;1;"Low";"New technologies speed up processes and allow for economies of scale, but traditionally produced products are generally perceived as premium and not in direct competition with mass produced ones.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries"
"MACRO";"Environmental";2;3;"Medium High";"If the enterprise relies on produce grown in a specific area (e.g., wines, cider, spirits of denominated origin), it may be heavily impacted by climate change/ global warming.
NOTE: Think about weather vs climate (what goes under economic/ availability of resources due to weather and what goes under Environmental).";3;"The level and nature of these risks vary to some extent from country to country.
Countries closer to the equator are likely to be more negatively impacted by global warming."
"INDUSTRY";"Existing competition";2;2;"Medium";"Status quo in alco: a few large players and many smaller ones. The products are highly differentiated, so the small players are somewhat protected from direct competition from the big players. Some big players tend to buy out smaller competitors.
NOTE: Here we talk about the industry structure, focusing on how easy or hard would it be for our new entrant to survive in this market.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country.
Especially in alco, largely affected by brewing/ distilling tradition."
"INDUSTRY";"Potential competition";3;2;"High Medium";"Industry attracts many (small) new entrants. However, due to the highly differentiated nature of the product and brand loyalty, the small players are not in fierce competition with each other.
NOTE: This is about the threat of entry. We talk about the extent to which our enterprise, once it establishes itself in the market, will be threatened by future entrants. Note that differentiation (as in the specialty brewing industry) protects both existing players and entrants from each other!";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country.
Especially in alco, largely affected by brewing/ distilling tradition."
"INDUSTRY";"Substitution possibilities";1;2;"Low Medium";"Alcoholic beverages hold a unique position due to tradition. While substitution between different types of beverages is common, mass substitution towards entirely different products seems quite unlikely. Furthermore, should new alternatives emerge, it is likely many consumers will remain loyal to their current drinks of choice.
NOTE: Check what counts as emergence of a substitute vs. simply new entry in the same market.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries."
"INDUSTRY";"Power of suppliers";2;2;"Medium";"The bargaining power of suppliers depends on the type of beverage and the business model of the producer. In case of a winery owning its vineyards, this risk is low. In the case of a craft brewery buying its malts and hops, key suppliers hold significant power.";3;"The level and nature of these risks vary to some extent from country to country.
Substantial international differences exist, but they are to a large extent the result of different predominant products and business models"
"INDUSTRY";"Power of buyers";2;2;"Medium";"The bargaining power of buyers depends on the chosen distribution channels and volume of sales. If most of the production is sold directly to consumers and via restaurants, bars, and cafes, the bargaining power of buyers is low. If much of the production is sold via wholesalers/ supermarket chains, buyers hold much more power. Switching between channels is costly and may not be possible in the short run.";3;"The level and nature of these risks vary to some extent from country to country.
Variations depend on consumption patterns (home vs bar consumption), government policies regarding the distribution of alcohol, and structure of retail markets (the extent to which the largest chains dominate)."
"COMPANY";"Resources: Human";2;3;"Medium High";"This industry, especially its craft/specialty sector, is to a large extent dependent on the skill and experience of a few key personnel (master brewer/ distiller/ winemaker). Losing these key people can be disastrous to the whole operation and finding a replacement at short notice is likely to be difficult. Relatedly, to ensure continuity, it is important to keep detailed documentation of the employed procedures/ recipes.";2;"The level and nature of these risks vary slightly from country to country.
Availability of skilled personnel for a particular drink may vary based on a countryâ€™s traditions."
"COMPANY";"Resources: Tangible";1;1;"Low";"After the initial investments have been made, the production equipment should last for a fairly long time. Repairs are unlikely to be excessively costly and can often be done in-house.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries."
"COMPANY";"Processes";2;3;"Medium High";"For all fermented drinks, contamination during any stage of the process (fermentation, bottling, storage) can result in an inferior product or even total loss of a batch. Furthermore, fermentation is subject to natural variation (e.g., in response to changes in the ambient temperature) even when no contamination occurs.
NOTE: This is mostly about operational processes but supporting processes might be mentioned if they have industry-specific issues/ potential risks.";1;"The level and nature of these risks are virtually the same in all countries."
