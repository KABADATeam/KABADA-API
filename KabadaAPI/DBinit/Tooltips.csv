17;;Yes;overview;Industry risks;Industry risks - left side text;Industry risks;The purpose of risk assessment is to provide new entrepreneurs with a structured overview of the risks their new businesses may face, depending on the industry in which they plan to operate. Raising awareness of the potential risks will help entrepreneurs take appropriate action to avoid them or at least mitigate their impact. ;;;;;;
18;;Yes;overview;Industry risks;Macro;Macro;Risks, which arise from factors at the national or global levels.;;;;;;
19;;No;overview;Industry risks;Macro;Political and legal;In this section, we consider risks arising from factors such as government policies, regulations, and laws. The section is particularly important in highly regulated industries.;;;;;;
20;;No;overview;Industry risks;Macro;Economic;Here we consider factors that depend on the overall functioning of the economy. These may include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates (particularly in exporting industries and industries relying on imports), changes in the overall wealth and income in the economy, business cycles (booms and recessions), inflation, quality of infrastructure (e.g., roads and airports), access to financial markets/ credit, and availability of human resources. ;;;;;;

Most importantly, this includes technological developments that can render companies in the industry in question obsolete. (As an example, consider the advent of personal computers, which caused the demise of typewriters.) In addition, this category also includes risks that arise from the use of technology, particularly, information and communications technology, cybersecurity being the prime example. ;;;;;;

26;;No;overview;Industry risks;Industry;Potential competition;This category discusses the threat of new entry. It is therefore the flipside of the previous category. Here we talk about the extent to which our enterprise, once it establishes itself in the market, will be threatened by future entrants (i.e., unlike the previous category, here our entrepreneur is in the shoes of an existing player, not an entrant). ;;;;;;
27;;No;overview;Industry risks;Industry;Substitution possibilities;This category concerns the extent to which the emergence of new substitute products/ services might displace those of companies in the industry in question. ;;;;;;
